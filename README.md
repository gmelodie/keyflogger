# KeyFlogger
Minimalistic CLI keylogger


According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flogger), Flogger may refer to:

- Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 "Flogger", a Russian fighter aircraft
- Mikoyan MiG-27 "Flogger-D/J", a Russian ground-attack aircraft
- Flogger (fashion), a teenage fashion originated in Argentina
- Someone who administers a flogging, or the device used for that purpose
- In the context of BDSM, a multi-tailed scourge typically made of soft leather

Let's add a new item to that list:

- Someone who gossips a lot, or who talks with people he/she shouldn't

## Did you really just made that up?
Yes. I like the shound of *flog* and it looks a lot like *log*.
